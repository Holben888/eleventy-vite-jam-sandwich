When thinking about modern, performant web apps, WordPress isn’t typically the first platform to come to mind. But as content management systems are concerned, WordPress is still king due to its long history and well-crafted UX. Can we break WordPress out of its serverful shell and use newer tech to deliver a fast and highly scalable web app? In this talk, Colby Fayock talks about how to get the best of both worlds, and derive a “WordPress at the Edge” approach. He shows an approach for how we can use WPGraphQL and Next.js to catch WordPress up with the modern web and build great experiences on the Jamstack.
