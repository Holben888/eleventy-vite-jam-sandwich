Matt Biilmann kicks off Jamstack Conf 2021 with an assessment of the Jamstack ecosystem, and an eye on how it started, and where it's going. He talks about how the modern web movement started five years ago, and how the Jamstack ecosystem has since exploded. Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity. The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.

Five years ago, that was a radical concept. Now, for new developers, Jamstack is the norm. In the past five years, we've seen the Jamstack grow from a manifest to a full-blown movement. 

So what's next for web developers? In this keynote talk, Matt talks React server components, serverless databases, and more about what's exciting key players in the Jamstack community. You'll hear from special guests about their thoughts on the Jamstack today, including:

- Evan You, creator of Vue and Vite
- Rich Harris, creator of Svelte and SvelteKit
- Dana Lawson, SVP of Engineering at Netlify
- Thor Schaeff, Supabase

Together, Matt's keynote and voices from the Jamstack community offer keen insights into not only where the Jamstack is today, but where we're going next, and what the modern web is capable of.
