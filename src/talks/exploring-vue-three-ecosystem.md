Vue is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the Jamstack community. It’s open sourced and has a massive ecosystem behind it, which means there’s a lot of plug-ins and tools to use, and can be hard to navigate at first. In this talk, Ben Hong of Netlify talks about the Vue 3 Ecosystem, and the state of Vue 3 in 2021, including upcoming changes and recent additions such as: 

- First class TypeScript support 
- Composition API, a new way of writing components
- Improved performance
- New features without increasing bundle size 

Watch the full talk to learn more about Vue, and what the right fit for your project is.
